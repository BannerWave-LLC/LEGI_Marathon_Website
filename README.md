## About

A Craft CMS starter project using DDEV for local hosting and Vite for front-end bundling and HMR (HMR not working right now...)
After installing, go to et.ddev.site/admin to run the Craft CMS setup if needed.

## Notable Features:

- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/) for local development
- [Vite 4.x](https://vitejs.dev/) for front-end bundling & HMR
- [Tailwind 3.x](https://tailwindcss.com) for utility-first CSS
- [Alpine 3.x](https://alpinejs.dev/) for lightweight reactivity
- [Servd](https://servd.host/) as the default hosting environment
- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) for email delivery
- [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) for common CLI commands

## Local machine prerequisites:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/), minimum version 1.19
3. Optional but recommended, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Configuring DDEV

To configure your project to operate on a domain other than `https://craftcms.ddev.site`, run:

```shell
ddev config
```

Follow the prompts.

- **Project name:** e.g. `mysite` would result in a project URL of `https://mysite.ddev.site` (make note of this for later in the installation process)
- **Docroot location:** defaults to `web`, keep as-is
- **Project Type:** defaults to `php`, keep as-is

## Installing Craft

To install a clean version of Craft, run:

```shell
make install
```

Follow the prompts.

This command will:

1. Copy your local SSH keys into the container (handy if you are setting up [craft-scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts/))
2. Start your DDEV project
3. Install Composer
4. Install npm
5. Do a one-time build of Vite
6. Generate `APP_ID` and save to your `.env` file
7. Generate `SECURITY_KEY` and save to your `.env` file
8. Installing Craft for the first time, allowing you to set the admin's account credentials
9. Install all Craft plugins

Once the process is complete, type `ddev launch` to open the project in your default browser. üöÄ

## Local development with Vite

To begin development with Vite's dev server & HMR, run:

```shell
make dev
```

This command will:

1. Copy your local SSH keys into the container (handy if you are setting up [craft-scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts/))
2. Start your DDEV project
3. Install Composer
4. Install npm
5. Do a one-time build of Vite
6. Spin up the Vite dev server

Open up a browser to your project domain to verify that Vite is connected. Begin crafting beautiful things. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Makefile

A Makefile has been included to provide a unified CLI for common development commands.

- `make install` - Runs a complete one-time process to set the project up and install Craft.
- `make up` - Starts the DDEV project, ensuring that SSH keys have been added, and npm & Composer have been installed.
- `make dev` - Runs a one-time build of all front-end assets, then starts Vite's server for HMR.
- `make build` - Builds all front-end assets.
- `make pull` - Pull remote db & assets (requires setting up [craft-scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts/)
